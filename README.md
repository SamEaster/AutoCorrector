This is Simple small spelling correction model build using word similarity. I built by getting inspired from the Peter Novic's spelling correction model. 
My model is not better than him currently but i think if more research put on the model it can outperform it. My model is not accurate but it is fast.<br>
Model performance -<br>
For the dataset created using ChatGPT it is having accurracy of 75% with 138 words per second. On the Novic's test set it have accuracy of 57% and 47.5% which is lower than Novic's model
but due to smaller vocabulary of my model is encountering 60 and 153 unknown words out of 270 and 400 words. So ya, it needs improvements..
